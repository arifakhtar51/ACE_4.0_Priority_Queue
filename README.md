# BloodDonorNFT

BloodDonorNFT is a blockchain-based platform that incentivizes blood donation by rewarding donors with unique NFTs. This project connects hospitals, government agencies, and blood donors in a secure and transparent ecosystem.

## Overview

BloodDonorNFT addresses the global challenge of blood shortage by creating a rewarding system for donors. The platform verifies donations through hospital partnerships and issues digital certificates as NFTs, which can later be redeemed for various benefits.

## Features

- **Multi-Role System**: Separate dashboards and functionality for government agencies, hospitals, and blood donors
- **Blockchain Verification**: Secure, transparent recording of donation events
- **NFT Rewards**: Digital certificates issued as non-fungible tokens
- **Donation Tracking**: Complete history of donations with verification status
- **Hospital Management**: Government agencies can approve and manage participating hospitals
- **Mobile Responsive**: Fully responsive design that works on all devices

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with React Router for navigation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom gradient and animation effects
- **UI Components**: Custom components with responsive design
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Local Storage**: Persistent user sessions and preferences
- **Visual Effects**: Particle background and modern UI elements
